-& written within a member function:
Example:
    String & operator=(const String &)
    
Here we have "&" within the name of a member function. This means that we will be 
returning by reference. In this case, we are returning a string by referencing the
object.

-& within the parameter:
    The "&" here is pass-by-reference. Unlike the example above, we are passing
    an object by reference. And once all is done, we are returning that same
    object by reference. That explains the syntax.

-const within the parameter:
    This means that the object being passed cannot be modified.
